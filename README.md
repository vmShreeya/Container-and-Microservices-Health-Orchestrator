# Container-and-Microservices-Health-Orchestrator
This project monitors containerized microservices, predicts potential failures using resource metrics (CPU, memory, latency), and triggers self-healing actions like scaling or rerouting traffic.

## 📁 Features
- Health Monitoring
- Failure Prediction
- Healing Actions
- Modular Java Design
- Uses CSV Dataset for Simulation

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open in Eclipse as a Maven Project
2. Run `App.java` from `app` package
3. Ensure `health_metrics.csv` is in root directory

## 📊 Dataset
Located in `health_metrics.csv` (you can extend it for more realistic simulation)

## 🔧 Technologies
- Java 11+
- Maven
